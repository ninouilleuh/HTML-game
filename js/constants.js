// YES:

// Global constants (values that do not change during gameplay)
// Configuration values (tile colors, pixel size, season names, etc.)
// Utility functions that are truly constant (e.g., isDay() if it just checks a value)
// Global variables that are set once and rarely changed (e.g., window.isMobile, window.pixelSize)

// NO:

// Game state variables that change frequently (e.g., totalDay, seasonDay, currentSeasonIndex, currentSeason)
// Functions that modify game state (e.g., advanceSeasonDay())
// Game logic or mechanics (e.g., day/night cycle logic, season advancement)
// Temporary or dynamic values (e.g., message)
